# OSHCamp 2019 Workshop - Customising RI5CY: an open-source RISC-V core

The goal of the workshop is, starting with some basic Verilog and C++ knowledge,
to design and implement some new instructions in RI5CY, a 4-stage in-order
pipelined RISC-V processor.

## Workshop files

Files for the workshop are:

* [workshop.odt](workshop.odt) The tutorial instructions for the workshop.
* [slides.odp](slides.odp) Slides for the talk prior to the workshop (OSHCamp
Saturday).
* [slides-notes.odt](slides-notes.odt) Notes accompanying the slides.

## Slack

There is a slack for discussion following the OSHCamp workshop, for those that
wish to start or complete the workshop following OSHCamp.

It is at
[https://oshcampri5cyworkshop.slack.com](https://oshcampri5cyworkshop.slack.com).

## Basic Verilog Workshops

If you need a more basic Verilog starting point, you may wish to work through:

* [Intro to Verilator with Verilog](https://gmarkall.wordpress.com/teaching) -
  uses cycle-accurate simulation.
* [Chip Hack](http://chiphack.org) - Using the MyStorm FPGA board.

## Other documents

There are some other useful documents included in this repository:

* The GTKWave manual.
* The RI5CY user manual.
* The RISC-V ELF psABI specification.
* The binutils RISC-V instruction formats documentation.
* The RISC-V specification, v2.3.
